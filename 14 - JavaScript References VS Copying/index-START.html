    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const concatPlayers = [].concat(players)
    const arrayFromPlayers = Array.from(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spredPlayers = [...players]

    concatPlayers[0] = 'concatPlayers'
    arrayFromPlayers[0] = 'arrayFromPlayers'
    spredPlayers[0] = 'spredPlayers'

    console.log(players)
    console.log(concatPlayers)
    console.log(arrayFromPlayers)
    console.log(spredPlayers)
    console.clear()

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer',
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const spreadPerson = {
      ...person,
      social: { ...person.social }
    }

    console.log(spreadPerson.social === person.social)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
